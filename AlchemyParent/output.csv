IDENTITY (ID),"Asset Management (ID.AM): The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization’s risk strategy.",ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried,"ForceSales inventories their physical devices and systems using ServiceNow. 

Within 24 hours of servers and other assets being brought into production, ServiceNow agents are deployed, registering the asset into the inventory database. ServiceNow is configured to update the inventory on an hourly basis to account for new systems, changing systems, and decommissioned systems.

The inventory powered by ServiceNow includes mobile devices as well. Please see ""FS Policy 0014: Asset Management"" for further details.","1) The company's description of their controls for NIST CSF subcategory ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried is 'Implemented'.
2) The rationale for this assessment is that the company is using ServiceNow to inventory their physical devices and systems. They have a process in place where ServiceNow agents are deployed within 24 hours of assets being brought into production, registering the asset into the inventory database. ServiceNow is also configured to update the inventory on an hourly basis to account for new, changing, and decommissioned systems. The inventory includes mobile devices as well.
3) No suggestions for improvement are necessary as the company has demonstrated a comprehensive approach to inventorying their physical devices and systems."
IDENTITY (ID),"Asset Management (ID.AM): The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization’s risk strategy.",ID.AM-2: Software platforms and applications within the organization are inventoried,"ForceSales is currently using a manual process to inventory software and applications being used by in-scope systems and ForceSales personnel. On a bi-monthly cadence, the head of security performs a review via interview of a random sample of ForceSales employees to understand which third-party software is being used. Depending on their answers, the head of security then updates an Excel spreadsheet with the relevant information.

ForceSales plans to automate this process in FY24 - there have been issues in the past with not properly tracking software platforms being used.","1) The company's description for NIST CSF subcategory ID.AM-2 is Partially Implemented.
2) The rationale for this assessment is that while the company has a process in place to inventory software platforms and applications, it is currently a manual process relying on interviews and an Excel spreadsheet. This method may not be comprehensive or accurate, leading to potential gaps in software inventory.
3) To improve, ForceSales should consider implementing an automated software inventory management system. This would provide more accurate and up-to-date information on software platforms and applications being used within the organization. Additionally, they should establish a regular and consistent process for conducting software inventory checks, rather than relying on a bi-monthly cadence. This will help ensure that the inventory remains accurate and reflects the current state of software usage."
